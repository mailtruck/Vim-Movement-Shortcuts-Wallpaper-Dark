# Vim-Movement-Shortcuts-Wallpaper-Dark v0.2


**v0.2 - added wallpaper for 11 inch macbook air ** 

I mashed up a pattern and a vim movement wallpaper.

Let me know if you want to see additional resolutions, textures, or fonts.

I suppose yu can also let me know if you would like to see cheat sheet wallpapers for anything else like tmux.

The pattern is an inverted version of the [tex2res](http://subtlepatterns.com/?p=1190) pattern by [Janos Koos](http://joxadesign.com/)
